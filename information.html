They were also warned about big waves, intense wind, and strong rain on the weekend. People were advised of flash floods in the low-lying areas which are prone to flood, and also landslides. DoH issued a white alert to its subordinates all along the typhoon's path and said that they should stock up on medicine and supplies so that the residents don't need to buy them. The next day, as the typhoon Mina became very intense, provinces of Isabela, Cagayan, and including the Babuyan islands were raised to a Storm warning signal 3.
