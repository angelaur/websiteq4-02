        <h1>TYPHOON MINA</h1><br><br>
        <p>Typhoon Mina, known internationally as Typhoon Nanmadol, struck the Philippines in August 2011, causing very significant damage to Northern Luzon,<br> particularly in Benguet, Cagayan, Apayao, Kalinga, and other mountain provinces. The typhoon resulted in power outages due to broken power lines and warnings about high waves.<br> Wind speeds during the typhoon reached 230 km/h (142 m/h), with a recorded pressure of 929 hPa at 8 am. Nanmadol was classified as a Violent Typhoon when it hit Sta Ana,<br> though its wind speeds slightly decreased to 225 km/h by 11 am. The storm brought over 400 millimeters (16 inches) of rain in a single day,<br> worsening the Southwest Monsoonal Flow across the Philippines and causing torrents and heavy rainfall.</p>
